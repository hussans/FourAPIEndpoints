**Project Name**: MiniChallengeFiveToSeven - Endpoints
<br/>
**Description**: Create an API with four endpoints, each having its own controller and service file. The endpoints are: 1) MadLib: generates a story from multiple inputs; 2) OddOrEven: checks if a number is odd or even; 3) ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): reverses a sequence of numbers and letters; 4) ReverseIt (Numbers Only): reverses a sequence of only numbers and shows both the original and reversed. Validation is required for all inputs.
